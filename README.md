## Process

- Using Twitter API to download tweets
- Identify tweets that contain emojis
- Process the tweets and use the emojis as labels
- Vectorize the tweets using tfidf
- Use NMF and topic modeling to group the tweets and print most common words in each topic
- Print the emojis associated with the tweets in each topic
- Find topics with a large percentage of similar emojis to connects words and emojis
- Currently applying NMF for tweets all with similar emojis to further identify associated words to find their slang definitions
